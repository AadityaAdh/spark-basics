SPARK_WORKER_CORES : Total number of cores to allow Spark applications to use on the machine (default: all available cores).

for example: if you have a cluster of 5 nodes(1 master and 4 slavenode) and each node configuration is 8 core and 32GB RAM... so by using the SPARK_WORKER_CORES we can configure how many cores spark can use per worker(i.e node). The default value is to use all cores. (hint: we need to also keep aside 2 cores for OS and 1 core for NM and 1 for Spark Daemons)

SPARK_EXECUTOR_CORES : This property is to control cores in the executor level. spark can launch many executors per each worker(i.e, node) based on the resource availability. this condition should always satisfy(SPARK_EXECUTOR_CORES < SPARK_WORKER_CORES)

if you configure SPARK_WORKER_CORES = 5 cores and SPARK_EXECUTOR_CORES=1 then spark can run 5 executors in each machine.

note: SPARK_WORKER_CORES property only makes sense when you are running spark on Spark Standalone Mode.

Excellent question — and very important to clarify.

### 🔹 `SPARK_WORKER_CORES` and `SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY`

These settings are for the **Spark Worker** — not the **executors** directly.

---

## 🔧 Spark Architecture Overview:

* **Driver**: Sends tasks to executors.
* **Worker**: A process that **runs executors**.
* **Executor**: A JVM process launched on a worker node to execute tasks and store data.

---

### ✅ What `SPARK_WORKER_CORES` and `SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY` Do:

* They **limit the total resources** a **Spark Worker** can use **across all executors it runs**.
* Executors launched on that worker will share the resources you define here.

### For example:

```bash
SPARK_WORKER_CORES=4
SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY=4g
```

This means:

* The Spark worker can **host executors that in total use up to 4 cores and 4 GB of RAM**.
* You can have **1 executor with 4 cores**, or **2 executors with 2 cores each**, etc., depending on how the executors are requested.

---

## 🧠 To control executor resources specifically, use:

In your **Spark submit** command or config:

```bash
--executor-cores 2
--executor-memory 2g
```

These tell Spark:

* Each executor should use 2 cores
* Each executor should use 2 GB of memory

So the **worker must have enough available resources** to satisfy those.

## 🔁 Summary:

| Setting               | Applies To | Purpose                                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SPARK_WORKER_CORES`  | Worker     | Max **total cores** a worker can give to executors      |
| `SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY` | Worker     | Max **total memory** a worker can allocate to executors |
| `--executor-cores`    | Executor   | How many cores a single executor uses                   |
| `--executor-memory`   | Executor   | How much memory a single executor uses                  |

i belive this chat gpt respose is correct as per the stack overflow response
